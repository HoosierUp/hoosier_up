This is an application which helps create a virtual camp environment for youth athletes to participate in.

We have two variations of the application that serve the same purpose.
The working app is in the for of a custimized RESTful API hosted by Talentlms.
TalentLms is a subscription based cloud Learning management software solution 
that is integration with thousands of other webapps, api, etc to make each learning solution 
truly unique.

For our mobile iteration, we settled on creating a responsive wireframe with the same features 
as the enterprise talentlms application but with a more fluid UI.
